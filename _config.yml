  Hi! This is Tareq. I am a Lecturer at Department of Computer Science 
  and Engineering (CSE) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology 
  (BUET). I am also currently pursuing Masters of Science at CSE, BUET. I am
  fortunate to be supervised by Professor Dr. Mohammed Eunus Ali. My research
  interest lies in Graph Neural Network and Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning.

          <h4><b>
            PathOracle - A Deep Learning Based Trip Planner for Daily Commuters
          </b></h4><br>

          Every day millions of users use trip planners (or
          equivalently journey planners) for smooth and convenient daily
          commuting using public transport. These trip planners (e.g.,
          Google Maps trip planner) allow users to search for an optimal
          means (e.g., fastest or minimum switches) of travelling between
          two locations in the city using public transport, where a single
          trip may use a sequence of several modes of transport based
          on the available transport networks and the timetables of the
          services. In this paper, we take an orthogonal and a completely
          novel data-driven approach for a trip planner, that finds the most
          popular trip from historical trips, given a source, a destination,
          and user-defined constraints such as time, minimum switches,
          or preferred modes of transport. To solve the most popular
          trip and its variants, we propose a multi-stage deep learning
          architecture PathOracle that consists of two major components:
          KSNet to generate key stops, and MPTNet to generate popular
          path trips from a source to a destination passing through the key
          stops. We also introduce a unique representation of stops using
          Stop2Vec that considers both the neighborhood and trip popularity 
          between stops to facilitate accurate path planning. We present
          an extensive experimental study with a large real-world public
          transport based commuting Myki dataset of Melbourne city, and
          demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

            Learning Indoor Layouts from Simple Point-Clouds
          </b></h4><br>

          Reconstructing a layout of indoor spaces has been a crucial part of growing 
          indoor location based services. One of the key challenges in the proliferation 
          of indoor location based services is the unavailability of indoor spatial maps 
          due to the complex nature of capturing an indoor space model (e.g., floor plan) 
          of an existing building. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically 
          generate floor plans that can recognize rooms from the point-clouds obtained 
          through smartphones like Google's Tango. In particular, we propose two 
          approaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network 
          and a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify 
          rooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on 
          different datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union 
          scores, which show that our models can effectively identify the rooms and regenerate 
          the shapes of the rooms in heterogeneous environment.

          Handwritten digit recognition has been the “hello world” of deep learning. 
          Yet, there are no significant work on Bengali handwritten digits due to a 
          lack of benchmark dataset. NumtaDB is the largest dataset on Bengali handwritten 
          digits and currently we have the best accuracy of 99.3359% on it. We used popular 
          CNN architectures namely, ResNet34 and Resnet50. We preprocessed the data, used data 
          augmentation, and trained our models with augmented data. We tested our models on 
          both the raw test data and cleaned test data. We found that slightly underfitted 
          models work better on the test data. And finally ensembled our six best models to 
          get our final predictions. In this paper we describe some methods and techniques that 
          performs well in NumtaDB dataset.

      In my spare time, I like to try new frameworks and linux distros. 
      I love to build small apps/software/scripts for my own use. 
      Currently I am working intermittently on a researcher-friendly paper reader using ElectronJS.
